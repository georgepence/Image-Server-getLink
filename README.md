# Image-Server-getLink
Example Javascript code to get a link to an image from the Image Server and insert it into HTML.   The server.js file is just here to serve index.html; 
there is nothing to learn with server.js.    The index.html contains the javascript "fetch" to get an image, and then inserts it in the "image-div" div 
element.
